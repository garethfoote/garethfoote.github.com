### Mirror Project w/Mary Flanagan
* New Media artwork combining literary and visual communication.
* Using 2 bodies of text, one scraped from the hard drive of M.F. and the other from the work of historic American poets, a continuously generative new work will be composited and visualised.
* The existing poems form the stuctural constraints and the scraped text will be incorporated based on word classes (Adjective, Verb, Noun, etc) recognition.
* Scraped text will be incorporated based on Word Class recognition (Adjective, Verb, Noun, etc).
* So far:
  * have created scripts to traverse and scrape the hard drive.
  * have used a NL library to categories scraped text into word classes.
  * have used a NL library to parse poetry and markup poems with word classes.
